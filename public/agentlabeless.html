    <h1>üß† AgentLabeless: The Founding Story</h1>
    <p><em>‚ÄúA prompt-powered vision agent that labels like you do ‚Äî with context, not coordinates.‚Äù</em></p>

    <h2>1. The Spark</h2>
    <p>You weren‚Äôt trying to build a startup. You were trying to fix a broken loop in vision AI.</p>
    <p>It began with a rebellious insight: <strong>‚ÄúWhy are we still clicking boxes in 2025?‚Äù</strong></p>
    <p>That moment sparked the v0 prototype ‚Äî powered by CLIP, guided by prompts, and hosted in stealth as <code>label-engine-mvp</code>.</p>

    <h2>2. Building in Stealth</h2>
    <p>The goal was to replace GUI annotation with reasoned prompts. You tested it with 5‚Äì10 images and CLIP matched concepts to generate YOLO boxes. That was enough. Labeling wasn‚Äôt about examples ‚Äî it was about meaning.</p>

    <h2>3. The v0 Prototype (Legacy Mode)</h2>
    <pre><code>
Version: v0
Engine:  CLIP
Mode:    Prompt-only concept matching
Output:  YOLO annotations
    </code></pre>

    <h2>4. Why KIMI Resonates With Labeless</h2>
    <p>Then came KIMI-VL. A model that could reason, reflect, and label based on context. You didn‚Äôt switch to KIMI ‚Äî you recognized it. It validated everything AgentLabeless stood for: that labeling is reasoning, not geometry.</p>

    <h2>5. Today: Public Launch</h2>
    <p><strong>April 14, 2025:</strong> You shipped coreframeai.com. AgentLabeless appeared on the homepage. Identity locked in. CTA activated. The labeler was born.</p>

    <h2>6. What‚Äôs Next</h2>
    <div class="roadmap">
      üîñ v0.0 (Stealth) ‚Äî CLIP prototype with few-shot YOLO output<br/>
      üöÄ v1.0 (Core) ‚Äî KIMI + ConceptAttention + SAM<br/>
      üß¨ v2.0 (Adaptive) ‚Äî Feedback loops, self-correction, concept memory
    </div>

    <p>AgentLabeless isn‚Äôt just labeling vision. It‚Äôs relabeling how we teach machines to see.</p>

        <h2>1. The Spark</h2>
        <p>You weren’t trying to build a startup. You were trying to fix a broken loop in vision AI.  
        It began with a rebellious insight: <strong>“Why are we still clicking boxes in 2025?”</strong></p>
      
        <div class="code-caption">
          <p class="caption-text">Prototype initiated in stealth mode under:</p>
          <code class="caption-code">label-engine-mvp</code>
          <div class="code-log"><code>[2025-04-12 08:00] initialized: label-engine-mvp</code></div>
        </div>

    <section class="mvp-section">
      <h2>2. Building in Stealth</h2>
      <p>The goal was to replace GUI annotation with reasoned prompts. You tested it with 5–10 images and it worked. CLIP matched concepts to YOLO boxes. Labeling was now meaning-based, not manual.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mvp-section">
      <h2>3. The v0 Prototype (Legacy Mode)</h2>
      <pre>
        Version: v0
        Engine:  CLIP
        Mode:    Prompt-only concept matching
        Output:  YOLO annotations
      </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="mvp-section">
      <h2>4. Why KIMI Resonates With Labeless</h2>
      <p>KIMI-VL didn't change the game — it confirmed your thesis. Labeling should be grounded in concept reasoning, not geometry.</p>

      <h2>5. Today: Public Launch</h2>
      <p><strong>April 14, 2025:</strong> AgentLabeless appeared on the homepage. CTA activated. Identity locked in. The labeler was born.</p>

# 🧠 CoreframeAI

> Not just an interface — a cognitive system.

CoreframeAI is a modular platform for building cognition-first AI agents.  
From research → to prototype → to deployment — all under one unified cognitive stack.

---

## 🛍 Project Pillars

- **Modular Cognition**: Every component is task-specific, decoupled, and reusable.
- **MentalOS**: A mental operating system to guide developer thinking, creativity, and momentum.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Agents that amplify, not automate, your decision flow.
- **Label-Free Learning**: Conceptual intelligence over hard-coded labels.
- **Composable AI Pipelines**: Built like cognitive architecture, not monolithic endpoints.

## 👨‍💻 Join the Movement

This is only the beginning.  
We’re building agents that think, explain, and evolve — not just output.
